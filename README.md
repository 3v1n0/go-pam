# Go PAM

This is a Go wrapper for the PAM application API. There's not much
else to be said. PAM is a simple API and now it's available for use in Go
applications.

There's an example of a "fake login" program in the examples directory.
Look at the pam module's [godocs][1] for details about the Go API, or refer
to the official [PAM documentation][2].
